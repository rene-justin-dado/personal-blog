# RJDev
This is a personal blog regarding my reflections on my experience of phase-0 with EDA, Nikau-2016. And in the future, maybe some things I think to talk about.

It is a WIP (pre-pre-alpha) and will change, **A LOT**.
Please bear with me as I hone my skills through this, and other projects. :)

I removed one 'pre'! I'm making some progress. But there's not much to see yet, besides the About page and a couple of early projects. XD
I also need to do a lot of styling work!


#Back-End
Back-end for the rj-dev blog repo at:
# http://rj-dev-backend.herokuapp.com/

Routes:
/v1/projects
/v1/blogs/
/v1/blogs/questions
/v1/blogs/answers
/v1/blogs/qna

# For the Future
The projects definitely need a 'credits' section. It's very important to give credit where credit's due!

The back-end is handling my current blogs how I need for now, but there's always more I could do.

It is not yet optimised for mobile, so that's something to think about. XD
